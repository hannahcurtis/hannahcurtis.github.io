Hello! I'm a master's student in the Water Resources Engineering Group at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I started at UW-Madison in Fall 2022 and am part of the Hydroecology Lab led by Dr. Steve Loheide. I'm also currently a student hydrologist intern at the Upper Midwest Science Center branch of the US Geological Survey.

My research interests fall under the umbrellas of stormwater management, green infrastructure, ecohydrology, and statistical modeling. My thesis project is focused on understanding the hydrologic, engineering design, and watershed drivers of ecosystem service function in stormwater detention ponds with the goal of being able to design ponds in the future to maximize both the main ecosystem services that ponds are designed for, flood reduction and water quality improvements, and the secondary ecosystem services, such as biodiversity, downstream environmental flow regimes, and aesthetic value. At the USGS, I've worked on projects applying statistical modeling to green infrastructure and stormwater pond performance.

I graduated from the University of Oklahoma in December 2021, with a Bachelor of Science degree in Environmental Engineering, a Bachelor of Musical Arts in cello performance, and a minor in Environmental Sustainability. During my undergraduate career, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant with the Oklahoma Water Survey and the Center for Restoration of Ecosystems and Watersheds. There, I worked on projects related to 

I grew up in Norman, Oklahoma and moved to Madison, Wisconsin in January 2022 with my partner Jack. Outside of work, I enjoy playing cello in the Middleton Community Orchestra and being in nature through biking, hiking, paddleboarding, and gardening.
